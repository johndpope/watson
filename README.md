Watson
======
Link your Dropbox account to Watson, and he'll listen for any updated photos, and show you only the best*. Idea blatantly ripped off of [everpix](https://github.com/everpix) but Dropbox hosts the originals, and you host the website. 

\* Best means of 0.5 or greater on an arbitrary quality scale and not a duplicate.

### Warning
This was built at [HackTeck 2014](http://www.hacktech.io/) in 36 hours, and lacks proper documentation of requirements or style. Sorry about that.
