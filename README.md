Watson
======
Link your Dropbox account to Watson, and he'll listen for any updated photos, and show you only the best*. Idea blatantly ripped off of [everpix](https://github.com/everpix) but Dropbox hosts the originals, and you host the website. 

\* Best means of 0.5 or greater on an arbitrary quality scale and not a duplicate.

### Here's what it looks like when you log in
![watson home page](https://raw.github.com/watson-app/watson/master/media/img/screenshot.png)

### Run
For the site:
`./start`

For the scraper:
`python scrape.py # & to taste`

### Warning
This was built at [HackTeck 2014](http://www.hacktech.io/) in 36 hours, and lacks proper documentation of requirements or stuff. All I remember is python, django, and mongo are required. Sorry about that.
